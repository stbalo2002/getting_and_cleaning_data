# INTRODUCTION

This repo contains my course project on Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data". In this repo, there are:

*  run_analysis.R script which contains the functions I executed on the assignment
*  This Readme.md file which describes the assignment and how the scripts work, and
*  CodeBook.md which contains the details of the codes in the assignment.

#  ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The assignment involves merging two different data sets together (train and test datasets), extracting some variables,
renaming those variables, and labelling the "activities" column. Finally, summarizing the dataset with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.

#  HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS

*  clone this repo to a local file
*  open Rstudio and source the "run_analysis.R" script setting the working directory to the 
   file containing the unzipped dataset
*  run the script in the console
*  the output is the dataset showing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Looking forward to your feedback!!
